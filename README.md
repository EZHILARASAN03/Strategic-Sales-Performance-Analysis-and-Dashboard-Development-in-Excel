# Strategic-Sales-Performance-Analysis-and-Dashboard-Development-in-Excel
**ðŸ“„ Project Description:**  ** Strategic Sales Performance Analysis and Dashboard**
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to evaluate business performance across multiple dimensions such as city, branch, customer type, and product line. The core objective is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful insights using Excel tools and visualizations.

Using data from the Strategic Sales Performance Analysis.xlsx file, we built an interactive sales dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore key metrics like total sales, gross income, and customer behavior dynamically. The dashboard includes pivot tables, slicers, and charts to facilitate multi-dimensional analysis and uncover trends, patterns, and performance gaps.

The final dashboard empowers decision-makers to:

Monitor sales performance across time and geography

Identify top-performing products and locations

Understand customer segmentation and preferences

Make data-driven strategic decisions

This analysis serves as a foundational model for performance tracking, operational improvements, and revenue growth strategies in a retail environment.
